# Greetings! Shashank Tomar here.


## About me
```
I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for building robust and reliable software. My journey in development has given me a strong foundation in a variety of languages, from system-level programming with Rust and C++ to object-oriented development in Java and Python.

On the frontend, I enjoy bringing ideas to life with clean and modern designs, leveraging HTML5, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. I believe a good project is one that not only works well but also looks and feels great.

My commitment to quality extends to my work in QA/QC, where I focus on ensuring that every piece of code is solid and bug-free. Iâ€™m always looking to learn and collaborate on new projects. Feel free to check out my repos
